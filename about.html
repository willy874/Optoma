                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The Optoma brand had its origins as early as 1992 under the Coretronic Group. Regional headquarters were established in the Americas and Europe in 1995 and 1997 respectively leading up to Optoma Corporation becoming globally established in 2002. </p>
                    <p>Making strides in visual display technologies, Optoma launched itself onto the international stage in 2002 by announcing the world’s first 65-inch DLP® projection television and winning the CES Innovations Award.</p>
                    <p>In 2014, Optoma acquired NuForce, a Hi-End audio company based in Milpitas, California. Audio is essential for a truly immersive entertainment experience. Optoma mastered the technique to provide end users with an exciting audio-visual entertainment experience and has been continually innovating new experiences for Home Cinema with supreme sound quality.</p>
